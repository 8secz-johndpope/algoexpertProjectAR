# algoexpertProjectAR
here is a project for the algoexpert

Cool project using swift and the Augmented reality project ARKIT.
The goal of this little mobile application is to create an app that scan a QRCODe then return an Id( random for instance ?)
and then we will get the 3d object linked to the id number.

For instance we will use bluemix for the servor part
